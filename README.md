My project displays various Bitcoin information from 3 API source points. All of my data came from the CryptoCompare API, using React, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React Router. 

To begin, you will need to have React and npm installed. Once those are installed, type npm start in the terminal. It will bring you to the home page, which displays a Navbar at the top of the page, containing 3 links to 3 different API points.

The Home page displays a table with the name of the coin, the symbol, an image, a url, and the total coin supply. It displays information for 50 different coins.

The Dollar Conversion page shows the price in US Dollars and Euros for 50 different Bitcoins.

The News feed page, presents a table of different headlines relating to Bitcoins.
